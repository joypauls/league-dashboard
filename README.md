---

## Dev Notes

### TODO

- setup pytest
- backup default to something when detecting system timezone in case of failure

### Version Bump

1. Change in `pyproject.toml`
2. Change `__version__` variable in`src/lgdash/__init__.py`

Should automate this eventually.

### Supported Leagues 

- start with just PL to get essentials out of the way then expand

### Match Retrieval Time Period

- default to today, emphasizes the fact that the data is live 
- keyword subcommands for `today`/`tomorrow`, + `upcoming` for scheduled

### Test Cases

#### Match Statuses

Look for Liverpool postponed match 2024 for handling postponed status.
